# 📝 Agentic MCST Evolutionary Framework – Design Document v1

---

## 1. System Overview

The framework orchestrates **autonomous problem-solving and self-improvement** using a **Monte Carlo Search Tree (MCST)** approach, applied to agents, prompts, and tools.
It decomposes user input, generates tasks, assigns agents and tools, then uses MCST to evolve and select the best solutions by generating, mutating, testing, and evaluating candidates.
**All artifacts (agents, prompts, tools) are versioned and their lineage tracked for transparency and reproducibility.**

---

## 2. Information Sequence & Flow

1. **User Prompt:**
   User submits an initial natural language request.

2. **Clarification:**

   * **Agent:** Clarifier (Generic LLM agent)
   * **Process:** System poses clarifying questions until requirements are clear.

3. **System Design:**

   * **Agent:** Designer (Generic LLM agent)
   * **Process:** Designs a high-level system architecture.

4. **Task List Generation:**

   * **Agent:** TaskLister (Generic LLM agent)
   * **Process:** Breaks system into concrete tasks.

5. **Tool & Agent Assignment:**

   * **Agent:** (Generic LLM agent)
   * **Process:** Assigns a tool sequence and agent for each task.

6. **MCST Launch for Each Executable Task:**

   * For each executable task, MCSTExecutor launches a controlled evolution loop, starting from versioned seed agent(s), prompt(s), and tool(s).

---

## 3. Classes & Responsibilities

### A. `Agent.py`

* **LLMAgent:**

  * Generic, used for all workflow roles (clarifier, designer, evaluator, evolver, judge, etc.) by swapping prompts.
* **EvolvingAgent:**

  * The subject of evolution (code, prompt, tool).
  * Can load/save its code and prompt as versioned files (e.g., `v2_1_agent.py`, `v2_1_prompt.txt`).
  * Each branch/version logs parent, mutation reason, and test results.

---

### B. `WorkflowManager.py`

* Orchestrates the flow:

  * user → clarifier → designer → tasklister → assignment → MCST for each executable task.
* For each task:

  * Runs pre-tools, launches MCSTExecutor, runs post-tools, aggregates results.

---

### C. `mcst_executor.py`

* **MCSTExecutor:**

  * For each task, starts with the initial (e.g., `v1_0_agent`).
  * At each depth/layer, uses an evolver agent to generate **N distinct children/branches** (by mutating agent code, prompt, and/or tools).
  * Each branch:

    * Executes its code/prompt/tool(s).
    * Is tested/evaluated using the code evaluator and judge agents.
  * Only the **best-scoring child/branch** is advanced; others are archived.
  * Repeats until stopping criteria (success, convergence, or max depth).

---

### D. `tool_manager.py`

* Registers, manages, and executes tools for pre/post task steps.
* Supports both immutable tools and versioned, evolving tools (tracked per MCST branch).

---

### E. `task.py`

* **Task:**

  * Stores description, assigned agent type, pre- and post-tool lists, evaluation criteria, status, history.

---

### F. `memory_manager.py` (Optional)

* Stores all agent/tool/prompt versions, MCST branches, performance logs, results.
* Supports lineage queries and replay.

---

### G. `prompts/`

* Contains all static workflow prompts for generic LLM agents.
* MCST-evolved agents/tools store their own prompt files, versioned by branch.

---

### H. `tools/` and `tools/evolving_tools/`

* `tools/`: Immutable core tools (git, file I/O, code executor, etc.).
* `tools/evolving_tools/`: Each MCST branch/version gets its own tool code and prompt.

---

### I. `evolution_logs/`

* Stores MCST tree structure, all metrics, and lineage metadata per evolution run.

---

## 4. MCST Control & Branching

* **Initial Node:** `v1_0_agent` (+prompt, +tool)
* **At Each Layer:**

  * MCSTExecutor uses evolver agent to propose **N distinct mutations/children**:

    * Each mutation is a new version of the agent code, prompt, and/or tools.
  * Each branch is:

    * Executed and tested
    * Evaluated and scored
  * **Selection:**

    * **Only the best branch advances** (to prevent exponential growth)
    * Others are archived (with lineage and performance logs)
* **Repeat:**

  * Evolve the best branch until:

    * Success criteria met
    * Max depth/layers reached
    * Judge agent decides no further improvement (convergence/stagnation)

---

## 5. MCST Diversity Mechanism

* **Mutation/Branching Prompt:**

  * The evolver agent (LLM) is explicitly prompted to propose N **distinct** mutations/children at each split.
  * Example prompt:

    > "Given the current agent code, prompt, and tools, generate 2 distinct new branches. Each should change a different core aspect (algorithm, prompt style, tool usage). For each, output new code, prompt, a description of the mutation, and rationale."
* **Diversity Controls:**

  * Encourage the LLM to avoid repetition, penalize duplicate mutations.
  * Adjust `temperature`, use random seeds, or mutation templates as needed.
* **Evaluation:**

  * The evaluator/judge selects the most promising/performant branch to keep evolving.

---

## 6. Versioning, Audit, & Lineage

* All agent, prompt, and tool files are saved per version/branch (e.g., `v3_2_agent.py`, `v3_2_prompt.txt`, `v3_2_websearch.py`).
* Each version logs:

  * Parent branch/version
  * Mutation rationale
  * Performance/score
  * Time/metadata
* **MCST tree structure** is saved per evolution run (`evolution_logs/run1_tree.json`).

---

## 7. End-to-End Sequence Example

1. **User:** "Build a web app for image classification."
2. **Clarifier:** Asks clarifying questions, user answers.
3. **Designer:** Proposes system design ("frontend, API, database, model").
4. **TaskList:** Breaks into tasks (frontend UI, API endpoint, database schema, etc.).
5. **Assign:** Assigns tools and agents to each task.
6. **For each executable task:**

   * MCSTExecutor starts with `v1_0_agent` (code, prompt, tool).
   * Evolver agent produces, e.g., `v2_0_agent` and `v2_1_agent` (two distinct mutations).
   * Each branch is run, tested, evaluated.
   * **Judge agent** selects best, which becomes the parent for next MCST layer.
   * Repeat until output meets criteria or max depth reached.
   * All code, prompts, tools, and logs are versioned and saved.

---

## 8. Stopping & Pruning Policy

* **Branching Factor:** N (e.g., 2 children per split, configurable)
* **Pruning:** Only the single best branch continues at each layer.
* **Stopping:**

  * Passes all test/eval criteria
  * No further improvement detected
  * Max tree depth/layers

## 11. Key Roles

| Role      | Function          | Prompt Strategy                  |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Evolver   | Proposes changes  | “Generate N distinct mutations”  |
| Evaluator | Tests/scoring     | “Test this code on…”             |
| Judge     | Picks best branch | “Select/merge best candidate(s)” |

---

## 12. Summary

* **Evaluator does NOT propose mutations—only tests and scores.**
* **LLM Evolver (with diversity-promoting prompts) creates multiple distinct candidates/branches for each MCST split.**
* **MCSTExecutor saves, executes, and evaluates each, then advances only the best branch (or top K, if you choose).**
* **All evolution is transparent, versioned, and auditable.**
